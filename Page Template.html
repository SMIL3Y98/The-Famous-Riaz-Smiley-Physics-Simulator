  <canvas id="canvas" width="640" height="480"></canvas>

<!-- The Canvas is new to HTML and is currently on track to replace Flash for games etc, Flash is officially a dying language/platform
The canvas element is where our programs will operate, it is the place where we can draw things and be in all ways awesome.

Since you can have multiple canvas elements, each canvas must have a name (you will put this name into your Javascript code), I have named my 
canvas element with the most imaginative name possible, the name is simply "canvas", I could have called it "canvas1" or "canvasGame" but because
I'm only using a single canvas, a cheap-o name will do.
